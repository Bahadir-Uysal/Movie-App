# Movie App
## In this project I created a movie app. I used a third party API. I pulled these APIs from db.org with a custom key code that I created. This data contains ratings and reviews of movie posters. Depending on what the ratings are, the color of the scores changes. There is also a search function, which sorts the movies according to the word you search for.
